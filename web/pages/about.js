              We are Milly and Maria, two friends from different sides of the
              world, making the most of a new life DOWN UNDER.
              <br />
              <br />
              On our world travels we connected with many types of cuisine and
              adapted to a variety of LOCAL PRODUCE. Today, after ten years on
              the road and a few auto-immune diseases later, we realised that
              well being is a journey that starts in the kitchen and that mother
              nature made seasons for a reason. We want to show a more
              SUSTAINABLE and TASTY way of living that not only makes you and
              your gut feel better, but is also kind to the planet. */}

            {/* Our story begins in the French alpine town of Chamonix Mont Blanc,
            where we first met and spent 5 years doing WHAT WE LOVE BEST, living
            an active outdoor lifestyle. We also both love exploring food and
            the many ways it can make you feel healthy and energised.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are now living in Perth, Western Australia, and have found that
            adapting to a new city and new life is harder than we expected. We
            know from experience that stress is a trigger for auto-immune
            diseases and many other conditions, so we are eager to redress the
            balance.{" "}

            is our journey to a change in lifestyle in order to stay HAPPY +
            HEALTHY.
            <br />
            <br />
            But hey where is the{" "}

            in all of this?
            <br />
            <br />
            With French and Argentinian roots, we grew up in cultures that were
            very much catered around meal time, with cuisines mostly meat based
            and with very little access to good vegetarian meals. Now fast
            forwarding 20 years, we continue to find that there could be more
            vegetarian variety on the market with HEALTHIER + TASTIER options.
            <br />
            <br />
            We want to inspire followers to cook in fabulous ways with VEG
            whilst at the same time reducing their meat intake but not feel too
            guilty if they slip from time to time. We know the importance of
            listening to the body and doing whatâ€™s right for it.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are combining flavours from our childhoods with ingredients from
            the different places we have travelled to, creating lovely memories
            of all the people we have shared meals with.
            <br />
            <br />
            So whether you are vegetarian, looking to reduce the meat in your
            diet or simply wanting to live a more SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE, we just
            want you to embrace the veg and make your meals{" "}
